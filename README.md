# Text Transformer (VS Code extension)

This extension provides advanced text transformation commands.

Still heavy WIP

All of the commands start with `Transformer:` to make them easier to find

## Features

`Transformer: Evaluate selected as inline javascript (transformer.inlineEval)`
 * Transform all selected lines by evaluating them as javascript
 * Keybind: ctrl+alt+q e

`Transformer: Increment all selected numbers by 1 (transformer.increment)`
 * Transform all selected numeric lines, increasing the number by 1
 * Keybind: ctrl+alt+numpad_add

`Transformer: Decrement all selected numbers by 1 (transformer.decrement)`
 * Transform all selected numeric lines, decreasing the number by 1
 * Keybind: ctrl+alt+numpad_subtract
